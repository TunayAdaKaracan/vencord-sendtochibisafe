# SendToChibisafe
Send To Chibisafe is a small plugin with the sole purpose of adding a context button to messages so you can send users messages and user uploaded files (*I am working on embed files*) to a chibisafe server.

**This plugin requires you to be a member of a chibisafe server**

### What is chibisafe?
Chibisafe is a file uploader service written in typescript that just works. It's easy to use, easy to deploy, free and open source. It accepts files, photos, documents, anything you imagine and gives you back a shareable link for you to send to others.

See [Chibisafe/Chibisafe](https://github.com/chibisafe/chibisafe) for more information

## Features
- Upload message as a text file
- Upload user uploaded images as their respective file
- Ability to upload to a specific album
- Copy sharable URL after uploading

## Configuration
1. Go to your server
2. Go to dashboard page
3. Click on "Credentials"
4. Request a new API key if you don't already have one
5. Copy API key

### Note
I am not an experienced web developer nor am i familiar with TS. I just did this plugin because i want to upload something to my server without downloading, navigating to website, uploading, copying url.

If there is any error let me know but i can't promise that i will keep improving this or add other types of services as it is not my priority.

*This is the first plugin i did for Vencord*
